# Performing Text Mining on Twitter with python

This is a quick introduction about scraping tweets with **python** library *tweepy* (v. 3.3.0) to perform some Text Mining methods on the subsequent data.

## Wenger vs Mourinho

If you love football and watch the English Premier League on a regular basis, you must surely know that the rivalry between Arsène Wenger & José Mourinho is second to known. The target of this study will be to extract tweets about either manager and try to discover from this sample the popularity of both. We will analyse what people like about them, and what they don't. So the main topic here is sentiment analysis.

To perform this, we will use several modules from the **python** library *NLTK*

**Note :** the *twitter_data.txt* file was too voluminous, hence couldn't be uploaded on GitHub, so you won't be able to perform the very first steps of the analysis in scripts *data_concat.py* and *analyse_chiffres.py*, but it's not the central point of this project as it only consists in cleaning the data and building the dataframes filled with the tweets that were of interest to us. You can still check how it works though.
