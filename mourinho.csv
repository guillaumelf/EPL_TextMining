@ManUtd Fucking disgraceful. Blame individual errors, not Mourinho
Mourinho has 3rd season syndrome since the first season
Overrated Players. Mourinho fraud
Mourinho was right all this time. A wide player is seriously needed.
Mourinho fanbois who compare him to SAF have their best opportunity. Old man's teams used to come back from 2-0 to hammer teams they played.
"Mourinho post match comments is what i'm waiting for. Lately I don't see the difference btw him &amp; Moyes."
