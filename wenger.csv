Maitland-Niles looks dangerous. Imagine how dangerous he‚Äôd be if wenger actually played him in his right position?!?! üôÑ
@DaveDeeney11 Yeah wenger and most of our board need to go, then hopefully we might get somewhere
@Mkdiala_ ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ they tried to get Wenger out even during Zuma must fall protest with no luck, Gunners are the real prisoners of hope!
@BarstoolSam Wenger and Ted Thompson need to get together and look confused for everyone's amusement.
Wenger just loves to pop out these Swiss Army knife type players like AMN who can play multiple positions
Lacazette wasting another chance but man will call Wenger mad for subbing him off at 70 minutes üòÇ
Thank You Wenger for giving Maintland-Niles all those Europa league games
I think I was done with Wenger when he didnt resign Cesc
@hahostolze And Wenger will say he is in the red zone, play him and then he will get injured #pattern
Wenger will sub Laca in the 75th minute
People say that @LacazetteAlex has been a disappointment but I think he just hasn't gotten the opportunity. Wenger‚Ä¶ 
Lacazette looks void of confidence. Wenger destroys decent players you know
if this is what 50 million gets you now days in the market I can see why wenger has been such a stingy cunt over the years
@Stxmford Lmao Uncle Wenger masterclass x2 to send Arsenal packing from the Carabao Cup, it's all good bro
@_PJCN He is now my g Wenger changes lives
Wenger cannot take Lacazette off early today.
A confident Lacazette scores there. It's a shame Wenger has destroyed him already subbing him every game when he could get goals.
@G_andradee Wenger
Tbh wenger can out play conte's tactics like 7 in 10 meetings 
@Frederikjuul @nomi9mi Now you are just whining like Wenger. :p keep doing it ... it‚Äôs refreshing:D
@BennRogerss Mike Dean to parachute into the stadium, award Chelsea a 90th minute penalty and knee slide in front of Wenger. Save this tweet
When Lacazette plays like this, it's very hard for Wenger not to take him off by the 60'
Wilshere dives... no 2nd yellow. Holding should be off.... wonder if Wenger will comment on this???
Let‚Äôs see if Wenger moans now
You know why I‚Äôm afraid with Maitland-Niles? Cuz I think Wenger could ruin him. Play him regularly
Ref hands Wenger another talking point üòÇ
I‚Äôm now understanding why Wenger takes Lacazette off kmt
@MrDtAFC R they gonna give him a new contract at 300k a week? No chance. But I believe he wants to stay. Wenger kno‚Ä¶ 
Maitland Niles is decent.. another of those Wenger youngsters who will go on to be a consistent 6/10, peak 7/10
@Druelle3 I know he is better in Midfield or RWB but he is not comfortable at LWB but Wenger keeps playing him there
Ars√®ne Wenger could die and he would still be manager of Arsenal, AND Giroud still wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a game üò¥üò¥üò¥
If wenger does not see that ozil is really worth 250k plus, he's demented
@TosinKnows Wenger does whatever he wantsüòÇüòÇ making wingers cm, fullbacks and strikers that‚Äôs all he knowsüòÇ
I suppose Wenger didn't see that Wilshere dive?
Wonder if Wenger will be whinging about the referee not sending Wilshere off tonight? Scumbag.
@GCasanas7 0 goals last 6 games, why doesn't Wenger subs him?
Let's see Wenger moan about that one #ARSvCHE #ARSCHE
Wilshere very lucky he should be off for that. Wonder if Wenger will mention it though
looool wenger has deffo put pressure on these refs
Can't wait for Wenger to bring on Welbeck and Coquelin
@MrDtAFC oh dear jack. Taken to diving should be off will wenger day something
So I assume Wenger will come out and say how lucky Arsenal were with the ref not sending off Wilshere ü§î
@NeilSinclair67 Wenger had better come out after the match the way he did after the West Brom penalty. Wilshere and Holding should be off.
Lucky to have not received his second yellow card. Waiting for Wenger to whine :)
Refs bottled it! Wilshere should've been sent off. Such weak refereeing, doesn't want Wenger to be upset again.
Watch Wenger take LACA off soon
"@flacko_jnr Xhaka‚Äôs a shit DM, he can only pass so Wenger tryna protect him. 

Personally, I‚Äôd rather not play some‚Ä¶ "
Wonder how much Wenger will focus in his press conference on the red Wilshere should have got for diving?
I think all referee's are against us now after Wenger's comments. We're paying for it in this match. #ARSCHE
Hearing a lot of spare seats... Arsenal Wenger that.
#arsche #WENGER won't be happy with the referee and rightly so!
Arsene Wenger needs to take Jack Wilshere off. Otherwise, he'll get sent off.
That‚Äôs a fucking foul on Jack you twattttt. I hate Anthony Taylor. Wenger would call him fucking rubbish
Like I have said many times the officials are scared of #wenger both #holding and #wilshere should be off the field‚Ä¶ 
"Wonder if Wenger will be defending his teams attempts to gain FK's &amp; pens by diving?"
Waiting for Wenger to replace Wilshere with Iwobi so that i can go sleep.
Wenger whines about referees, gets some huge decisions his way. Same before the Spurs game too.  #bbcfootball
Wenger surely gotta sub Wilshere
I'm guessing Arsene Wenger won't be so vocal about refs making mistakes after that Wilshere incident.
@jackdarton_ Not saying I know more than wenger but he's been at the club 4 years one loan and hasn't really improved one bit
@StrengthMental Yes I want Wenger gone, what is your point?
#AnthonyTaylor should sent biscuit boy off ......#Wenger did you see that ....I bet not
Wenger remove Wilshere oh
Wonder if Wenger will praise the ref for not sending Wilshere off for that? #ARSCHE #wenger #ididntseeit
Swear if Wenger takes off Lacazette at 60 minutes @Arsenal üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò¶
Ok now we have about 3 players on orange cards. Wenger earn your salary.
Chelsea have now fielded 7 defenders in the pitch with Moses substitution. They're playing for a DRAW. Wenger MUST‚Ä¶ 
Lmaoooo Conte is scared of Wenger. Ode oshi üòÇüòÇ
Bet Wenger won‚Äôt be slating the officials later.
@BradleyLawlor1 Wenger said we already had enough quality in midfield and then bought him and Elneny. That man is something else loool
LACAZETTE CONFIDENCE NEEDS TO BE FUCKIN BOOSTED, I SWEAR IF WENGER TAKES HIM OUT I WILL LOSE IT
@Rondezvu I like to give players time and not believe the hype, but he is an example of Wenger failing. As a manage‚Ä¶ 
I wonder if Wenger will still be moaning that refs are against Arsenal after that Wilshere dive??
@Druelle3 It will under Wenger I 1000% agree
@usman_94_ Wenger only here one more season
@joethomlinson the refs in this league are pathetic how does Wenger get punished for comments yet Mike Dean's obvious bias gets nothing
@ChelseaFC Mustafi should alsO be off for his scissor tackle on Hazard. Wenger has missed it all, no doubt.‚Ä¶ 
Everyone is playing well for Arsenal, I don't know who Wenger will subtitled
Conte got the memo too. Wenger doing no wrong with the Niles selection- so far
Wonder if Wenger will mention the fact that wiltshite should of been sent off for a second yellow when he dived . S‚Ä¶ 
The fact Wenger had no discipline over #30 just shows how terribly managed this team is.
Daily Mail confirm Wenger have agreed to sell Sanchez to Man City 
@alanbrazil Neutral here but want Chelsea to win just to see another @piersmorgan Wenger Out Rant !!
"Arsenal vs Newcastle! Arsenal Boss Wenger Gives Update On Injured Duo Mustafi &amp; Ramsey  "
@ChelseaFC So only Jose Mourinho knows how to beat wenger
Wenger seems to be suffering this for 13 years üòÇ 
Anyone who thinks Conte is a better manager than Wenger is an absolute fucking retard.
@willesdengooner Wenger IS thug life. 
Anthony Taylor is such a poor referee. He‚Äôs almost as blind as Wenger. #ARSCHE
@Markie_Mark91 ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èjust want to see him play cm now dunno why Wenger acting
Wenger has produced another gem. Maitland-Niles is one of the best going full backs in the EPL
Lol, Wenger boys can fall hand oo 
Wenger will leave a tiring and frustrated Wilshere on for at least 80 mins despite the yellow
gotta give it to Wenger though, every season he tries to win the league with MCMs
Never doubt Wenger's defence choice.Once partnered djorou n hoyte n they managed to keep Chelshit at bay earning gunners a point
Wenger waiting for the 75th minutes to bring in Giroud... Who's going to score on the 87th min.
Is Maitland-Niles performance going to go unnoticed? 20 years of age and looks so composed. Fair play to Wenger for trusting him.
@zeezeeblog @CEO4TAG your mum looks like Wenger
Sure Wenger will criticise the ref for not sending off Wilshere for that dive.
Haha wenger lion 
@hesham786 no chance of Wenger selling to Mourinho for that little even if its 6 months left.
Arsenal just about to give away this game the Wenger will moan relentlessly about refereeing. #AFCvCFC
Conte looks like mourinho in his last year at Chelsea. Running out of ideas. Even wenger is changing formations
Where does wenger pull the left fulls  out of
"I think Arsene Wenger forced the entire Arsenal XI to wear sleevesüòÇ
#AFCvCFC"
Lol Conte is Wenger's BITCH
Lol can't wait for Wenger to moan at the fact Wilshere shouldn't be on the pitch.
"Wenger shudnt remove Lacazette pleeeaaase!
#ARSCHE"
Lol CONTE CANNOT BEAT WENGER BRO
Pleased Wenger is giving this Niles a run in the team. Said it in the Youth World Cup, but he‚Äôs gonna be a hell of a player #ARSCHE
I heard Wenger didn‚Äôt see the Wilshere dive
Wenger's bitch
I am sure Wenger will be pointing out the ref‚Äôs shortcomings in not sending off saint jack
I wonder if wenger will be slating the referee for not sending jack wilshire off for diving tonight?
"Buzzing for him tbh

Wenger has wasted him #wilshere"
Wenger really sabi flog conte
Oh yes the player that should‚Äôve been sent off about 3 minutes ago scores! Let‚Äôs see if Wenger complains about that!
Wenger masterclass my lordy
Shouldn‚Äôt be on the pitch I bet wenger won‚Äôt say anything
Goal from the guy that should be off for diving. Wenger complains about refs every week though.
Once again Conte being outclassed by Wenger. Embarrassing.
Sign him up wenger... sign him up!!!
So Wilshere should have been sent off and now scores. I'm sure Cech and Wenger won't moan about the ref today. #arsche
"Wenger &gt; Conte"
Will wenger complain about that decision to send off wilshere for that blatant dive before he scored I wonder ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
Don‚Äôt see Arsene Wenger moaning about the ref now do ya
For all the stick #wenger gets, his team play some classy football. #frugal #afc #arsenal
Wenger spends the week crying about officiating then one of his players who shouldn‚Äôt be on the pitch scores. It goes both ways. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wenger dey whip conte again
Show Wilshere the money now Wenger
Don‚Äôt think Wenger will be moaning about Wilshere not getting a 2nd yellow for diving do you?
Wenger has Conte's template
Cheating fat cunt shouldn‚Äôt even be on the pitch! wonder if wenger complains about that
Okay Wenger has to offer Wilshere a new contract
Wilshere scores and should be off the field   wenger won‚Äôt complain about that decision bollocks #chelsea
Conte is Wenger‚Äôs bitch
I wonder if #wenger will complain about the ref tonight?....ignoring that #wilshere should have received his 2nd ye‚Ä¶ 
Should've been sent off but hey Wenger won't have seen that will he?
Haha what you gonna say about that Wenger üòÇüòÇüòÇ
What Wenger is doing with Maitland-Niles, what Conte is doing with Christesen, what Mourinho is doing with Lingard‚Ä¶ 
@JacobSteinberg Wenger?
WENGER BETTER GIVE WILSHERE WHAT HE WANTS
Chelsea fans should feel aggrieved by that. Wilshere should arguably have seen red. Wenger won‚Äôt complain about that.
Conte puts too much respect on Wenger!
This conte shouldn't jus bother again he cant win arsene wenger agaiin in his career
Wheelchair shouldn't be on the pitch and he scores for the Goons Wenger won't complain about that Ref decision
Please don't take lacazette off in the 72nd minute wenger
Shouldn't even be on the pitch. Wenger won't mention that though
Conte is the 12th different managers Wenger has faced against Chelsea. insaneüíÜüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è#Legend 
Wonder if wenger will complain about the ref tonight, when Wiltshire should have sent off then scores.
WENGER: TOP MAN, BEST IN THE PREMIERSHIP
Wenger always moaning about referee decisions...well mate Wilshere shouldn‚Äôt even be on the pitch!
Shouldn't be on the pitch and scores  but doubt Wenger will moan about the ref #ArsvChe #ARSCHE
Wenger surely knows how to handle Conte
WENGER GIVE THE GUY A CONTRACT

Well, Conte is still Wenger's bitch apparently. üòÇ
I wonder if you‚Äôll here Wenger complaining that Jack Wiltshire should have been shown a second yellow card for diving about 10 minutes ago!
@007Malone @Imrann507 @Arsenal Only time will tell but while Wenger is in charge it looks bleek.
Wenger with the trademark fist pump celebration
You put your wenger in, you wenger out, in out in out..... #ARSvsCHE
Conte will never learn against Wenger
He shouldn't be on the pitch. Wenger will still be complaining about something
Lemme buzz Wenger on wossop? 
Will #wenger complain about the ref today? #wilshere should be off after that dive and now has potentially scored the winner.
Wonder if old moaning Wenger will bring up the fact that Wilshere shouldn‚Äôt a been on the pitch üëÄ
Okay. Wenger in
Conte gets mugged off by wenger on a regular, we're shambles
WENGER BALL ‚öΩ
So Wenger moaned about being robbed in the 1-1 against West Brom, wonder if he‚Äôll moan that Wilshere has made it 1-‚Ä¶ 
Laughable. Bet Wenger won't be moaning about the referees after that...
Conte is Wenger's bitch

Conte is Wenger's boy
Wenger has Conte‚Äôs nudes. How do we play so poorly against these fools?
The Arsene Wenger celebration cures cancer
Wenger doesn't celebrate too hard coz he might break something
"Wenger can you see dat dose referees decisions you tagged ""archaic"" can sometimes be lenient. Case in point was Lac‚Ä¶ "
Wenger outsmart him again
Even Wenger didn't look too happy when Wheelchair scored.
What an indictment of Wenger that he wanted rid of Wilshere for a token fee. Maintain on form he is the best midfielder in the country.
Conte is Wenger‚Äôs bitch.
Wenger‚Äôs got the measure of Conte. Arsenal his bogey team. From being so dominant against them this past decade, Ch‚Ä¶ 
Unbelievable work from Arsene Wenger - it‚Äôs only taken him 2 years to rebuild Maitland-Niles after Mick tried to destroy him at #itfc
Bumped...this guy shouldn‚Äôt be on the pitch...I don‚Äôt wanna hear wenger or arsenal fans cry again

@TalibJim üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Wenger has other plans
Wonder what Wenger will make of tonight‚Äôs refereeing performance?
Wilshere shouldn't even be on the pitch. Scores for Arsenal. I think Wenger has a point about English refs.
Wenger has Conte‚Äôs Number!
"Don't know what zapocosta came in to do. ...
Conte ...very weak against wenger"
Lmao imagine been outclassed by Wenger multiple times ?? Like how ? Wenger ??
Wenger has Conte‚Äôs number, and it pisses me right off
Fucking hell, I show more passion than Wenger when we score jumping around my living room,  he just about cracks a smile üòèüôÑüôà
Lacazette wan score. Lease Wenger no useless substitution.
CFC can‚Äôt complain, they‚Äôve been poor this half. AFC fans found their voice, Wenger in for now.
Wonder if wenger will be moaning that wilshere shouldnt even be on the pitch
Wenger can shut the fuck up about referees forever now.
Like Wenger have Conte ticket
Wenger really got Conte in a headlock. Conte can‚Äôt beat him
Wenger destroying Conte as per
Let‚Äôs see what Wenger says about the referee tonight?? Wilshere shouldn‚Äôt have been on the pitch to score
Wenger moans about refs... but he wont have seen Wilshere's dive obviously...
Will Conte ever stop bending over for Wenger?
Wenger wont be slabbering about the referee today!!! Wilshere shouldnt be on the pitch. #SkySports
Conte is turning out to be Wenger‚Äôs bitch
Conte be Wenger ein bad bitch. Mans dey eat am style biaa bi
If Wenger issues the order to sit now and brings on Coquelin I‚Äôll break my telly.
Wenger ball!!!!!!! Goal Wilshere!.
Conte is such a fraud ffs how get you get outclassed by Wenger
I‚Äôm thinking Wiltshire was only a few minutes to be subbed by Wenger
"This is how the cycle repeats.

Jack Wilshere signs a new contract. Arsene Wenger stays until 2030. This is Arsenal."
Conte literally can‚Äôt beat Wenger
Will wenger mention anything tonight about refs I wonder
Jack is back, I can see wenger smiling. Baba feyin se
Will wenger acknowledge their a goal up due to a ref failing to send the cheat off?
Any Coach that loses to wenger this much doesn‚Äôt deserve to be at my club... Conte is insane if he doesn‚Äôt make changes now!!!
Wenger wasn't going to celebrate, than saw who it was and couldn't not smile! #JackWilshere
Still blows my mind Wenger benched Lacazette for big games cus when you see him play he's a beast
When Wenger smiles you know it could've been only one man scoring: 
"At least we're in top 4

Arsenal deserved that win.

Wenger has Conte's number."
Arsenal look quality and a great goal. Wenger in.
Of ALL the managers to be a slave to its wenger üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Goal was coming. Morata at fault (not surprising) and Conte just can't seem to beat Wenger
Wilshere just unleashed a wenger smile. This game is getting tougher.
@SkySportsPL Disgrace that he is on the pitch but let‚Äôs hear Wenger moan about that!!! Refs are shit and ruin so many games
Get in! You need to renew Wiltshire‚Äôs contract now Wenger! #afcvcfc

@TheSunFootball Goal by a player who shouldn‚Äôt be on pitch, wonder if Wenger will say he got it wrong

Conte is forever Wenger l's bitch
Me tired a tell wenger fi play Wilshere ya now. And him deh play bare ball and me just wa bawl

Wenger schooling Conte yet again, Conte always shows him too much respect
Conte needs to do something about Wenger always beating him

The goal is a reward to A. Wenger @JackWilshere
a) Poor from Courtois b) Wheelchair should not've been on the pitch c) Will Wenger moan about poor reffing tonight?
Conte twerking for Wenger again I cba anymore

In Wenger we trust üòÇ #ARSCHE
@garryhayes Wenger has gained confidence over conte ever since Conte arrived
@tomgor Wenger is like the Theresa May of football
Wenger always dey school Conte, normal
When @JackWilshere was recalled after his loan lot of gooners weren't enthused with Wenger but he's been brilliant
Is Wenger going to complain about the referee not sending off Jack Wilshire? #ArsenalChelsea
I don't know how Wenger does it against Conte. He always has a way.
Sure Wenger be upset Wilshire did not get a few more passes going before the shot. #ARSCHE

Do you think arsene wenger will raise the issue that wilshere should of been given a 2nd yellow for diving  therefo‚Ä¶

Conte is to Wenger what Wenger is to Mourinho.
Wenger please please don't take Laca off
That‚Äôs what happens when u can‚Äôt bury your chances. Crazy, wenger just knows how to whip conte.
Wenger gets slated for his big game record but he‚Äôs got the better of Antonio Conte almost every time they‚Äôve faced each other
It is what it is, another loss to Arsenal, Conte's 4th loss to Wenger in 2 years, not surprised, not bothered.
@DanMooreMUFC Wenger will come out with his classic line when asked about the dive. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see it‚Äù.
I don't imagine #Wenger will be kicking the ref's changing room door down after this match regarding poor decisions‚Ä¶ 
Hahaha. See Wenger's celebration. He's not even convinced because it wasn't walked in to the net 
Arsenal look proper decent, this team could easy be up there but the world seems against poor little Wenger ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
Wilshere shouldnt have still been on the pitch but I'm quite sure Wenger will not accept that point of view. Only c‚Ä¶

@mxkoma True but there's  competition in that position so I don't see Wenger playing him there anytime soon
Gonna be funny when wenger calls out the ref for that pen when Wilshere shouldn't even be on the pitch
@Khaosan05 if it continues to a juicy deal for the lad, it will be one of Wenger's best man management pieces since the glory days
Wenger saw that but bet he didn't see Wilshere's dive. A very painful old man!
On the end of wrong penalty decision 2times in a row...unlucky Wenger

Another decision to rile Wenger as Chelski get a penalty which Hazard puts away with aplomb 1-1.
English refs hate Wenger a lot.  That's not a penalty.
Wenger is totally gonna hey banned any complaining about this penalty
Wenger will have another reason to whine.
These refs just want to kill Wenger and Arsenal fans
I actually feel sorry for Wenger for once, two horrible penalty decisions against him in the past two games. #ARSvsCHE
I fucking hate Wenger
Wenger will be incensed that Wilshere is still on the pitch.
Arsene Wenger is one funny man
Chelsea  are back 1-1. Wenger will bemoan  another  penalty  against  his team.
Wenger is 100% gonna right hook the 4th official.
"Hazard
1-1
Wenger...again, take a wild guess"
"Penalty Chelsea 
Hazard smart
Very debatable 
Wenger... Take a wild guess"

Arsenal 1-1 Chelsea"
Wenger and Arsenal have been unlucky with the officiating off late. That wasn't a penalty
Want Wenger to go at all their heads the fucking cheats. Drag them enough to get a lifetime ban
Refs fuck us over, Wenger complains, Wenger gets fined, refs do it all the more, and repeat
The refs answer Wenger's criticism in their own way... #bbcfootball
@MWiriGimiLLeR I can't believe this. Wenger Sasa ataongea apewe 10 match ban
Arsene Wenger needs to start bashing these bad decisions by these goats called referees
Arsene Wenger can complain about being fucked over by the ref but wilshere should not even be on the pitch and he went on to score
How hasn't Arsene Wenger got an heartattack yet?
Wenger is gonna fume again
Wenger gonna loose all his sanity. #ARSCHE
When two scum teams meet I always tend to favour a draw üòÑ Plus it is always cool to see Wenger going into meltdown. üòÇ #THFC #COYS
Wenger is permanently vexed
"I can't wait until DT tells Robbie that he's ""tired of it, Robbie. Wenger needs to go"" tonight"
I hope Wenger lays into the Ref again!
Conte is still Wenger's bitch though.
@Frederikjuul @nomi9mi Careful what you wish for ! üòÜ... although that was not a penalty. Wenger livid again !
Referees are hating wenger just now üòÇ
Do love seeing wenger having a melt down tho
I'm sure #wenger will complain about the pen though.
Wenger‚Äôs picking up another fine from the FA in his post match presser

Wow Wenger is really useless
Wenger must be fuming what an awful decision that is üòÇüòÇ this ref is a shambles
Hazard thrle cheat. Wenger will lose it again #ARSCHE
Cech needs to desperately change his penalty saving technique. He's become as stubborn as Wenger about it.
Wenger furious lool
Scenes when wenger hits the F.A official.

Eagerly waiting for Wenger's take on that penalty decision #ARSCHE
Wenger has been saying it for years you old twat, get your head out of peps ass 
Arsene Wenger may get banned after this game
Let it be known that arsene Wenger and Arsenal FC have been robbed of a match by FA appointed Refrees
Wenger gunna be reyt happy about that penalty decision üòÇüòÇ2 shocking calls against Arsenal in 2 games
Hazard on loan from drama school gets a penalty and they score. Not a happy Wenger. And he's right.
Do Gary Neville and Arsenal Wenger go to the same opticians?
Wenger defo right hooking the wife at all these decisions
Wonder if wenger's bothered that his teams goalscorer should have received a second yellow for diving and shouldn't have been on the pitch?
The more you see that penalty decision the more you feel like a stadium ban for Arsene Wenger is 100% worth it üòÇ #ARSCHE
Wenger just take a rest of the season ban and take out the ref üëäüèΩ
There‚Äôs an actual agenda against Wenger. The match officials hate arsenal

@daf_phillips13 Wenger be complaining again then
Wenger looks like he is going to go ballistic.
Love seeing Wenger flapping around on the sidelines in his sleeping bag!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
@BBCSport Wenger is right nonsense penalty
2 shit pens in 2 games, Wenger isn‚Äôt gonna be happy
Wenger‚Äôs gonna be livid. All week we‚Äôve been sharing about penalties and dodgy refereeing but that is gonna send him over the edge
@AdvancedMaushi Didnt i say that arsenal will give chance to Chelsea. Take that Wenger!!! #AFCvCFC
Wenger is gonna go off that was not a penalty lol

"Premier league ref's are absolutely fucking shite. 
For once Wenger is entitled for a moan at that. 
Shocking decision."
I feel bad for wenger man, unlucky as fucküòÖ
That‚Äôs a dive. I‚Äôm sure Wenger will be delighted when Hazard gets a 2 game ban next week #ARSCHE
#AFCvCFC Aserne Wenger was right about these referees
@premierleague we get it. The refs hate Arsene Wenger.
Absolutely love seeing Wenger getting fucked over. Can't wait for him to retire. #ARSCHE
Mike Dean's friends punish Wenger with more dodgy penalties!
Wenger will be fewminnnnn
Wenger cracks me up, look at him like he is all hard done by 10 mins after one of his players blatantly cheated and‚Ä¶ 
What a joke. Wenger needs to right hook Taylor
After that first half penalty incident not given, this wasn't supposed to be given too. The is refs wanna stress Wenger
Nothing better than seeing Wenger absolutely fuming üòÇ #ARSCHE
That's as soft a penalty as the 1 vs west Brom. Hazard goes down like he's been shot. Wenger is gonna get banned 4 ever at this rate. #afc
She said Wenger's face is now contorted üò≠
Hope Wenger goes all out on the refs after the game
wenger boutta rant on these refs post game
Disgraceful penalty against Arsenal again. Wenger every right to be utterly fuming after these last 2 games!! #ARSCHE
Wenger getting banned from the UK after that one

Excellent. Do hope Wenger is really pissed off.
Don't know what Wenger's getting shirty with the fourth official there for. Penalty all day long.
"Wenger yesterday on decisions going against us:
""It's a concerning coincidence."""
Wenger will get another charge before responding to the first one #Arsenal
"With Wilshere‚Äôs dive &amp; goal and Hazards cheap pen, seems to have squared up things up. Not that Wenger will see it that way."
Another dodgy penalty decision against Arsene Wenger... 
Another @FA charge incoming for Wenger
"I'm sure before the referees sit down for their meeting, they usually shout ""Wenger out!"""
Cue The Wenger Moan At Full Time, Not The Fact Wilshere Has Cheated And Shouldn't Be On The Pitch....
Wenger‚Äôs reaction to the penalty is the highlight of the season for me. He is absolutely LIVID #ARSCHE
No wonder Wenger is pissed - 2 shocking decisions in their last 2 games for pens @Arsenal
I feel for wenger. We definitely need Video technology for penalty decisions
@FA yet again, another dubious penalty given by your team of refs. What are you going to do about it? Oh yeah, we know, punish Wenger!
Sit down Wenger and stop moaning, golden boy Jack shouldn‚Äôt even be on the pitch!
@rab08lfc @coliver1980 @busterblairlfc @clements_robert Soft as fuck! Wenger will be fuming again
Wenger's going to need a straight jacket   #ARSCHE
How the fuck is that a penalty? Ridiculous! Wenger about to rip off his shirt and stab up some refs I reckon! Cech‚Ä¶ 
Wenger moaning again! Absolute hypocritical clown!
It cheers me up seeing Wenger raging.
@marissatom16 Soft penalty.minimal contact.wenger furious.üò§
Another one it‚Äôs like the Refs got a campaign against Wenger right now
Great seeing Wenger fume though, innit.
@henrywinter That's Wenger's post-match repartee sorted thenüòë
Sir Alex Ferguson congratulates Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. 
Feel sorry for the day anyone gets in the way of Arsene Wenger when he is able to unzip his coat
Another soft penalty was the last thing Wenger needed üòÖ #ARSCHE
Gotta feel for wenger. Conceding two penalties in two games, and neither should have even been considered.
I want Wenger to start chinning every official in sight, 2 disgraceful refereeing decisions in 2 games #AFCvCFC
Can‚Äôt wait for Wenger‚Äôs post match interview. Should take a 10 match ban and just let loose #AFCvCFC
Poor Wenger nailed on to end up in a straight jacket #otterns
@Arsenal Wenger has an excuse nowüòÉ
"Another controversial spot kick...Wenger gonna kill some1 this time round. 
Its all square 1-1. #AFCvCFC"
Idk, at what point can Wenger give a heated press conference and claim that there's a campaign against Arsenal?
Wenger/Arsenal is blowing fucking smoke rings. I would be as well.       Fuck ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Now I‚Äôm hardly Wenger or Arsenal‚Äôs biggest fan (huge understatement) but those penalty decisions against them this‚Ä¶ 
in one match, Arsenal get booked for diving and give a penalty for another blatant dive? you already gave Wenger a‚Ä¶ 
That's an appalling decision, 50/50 challenge. No wonder wenger is frustrated on the sidelines. #ARSvsCHE
Good goal by Jack Wilshire for Arsenal but let's now see if Arsene Wenger mentions anything about the fact that Wil‚Ä¶ 
Taylor saw the situation with Wenger this week and decided to just fucking go for broke. Cunt.
They never show Arsene Wenger successfully doing up his zip, that's media bias at its worst.
"Watching football with my Mum is hilarious.

On Wenger: "" watch he walking and pacing bout di place like ah turkey""."
Wenger gonna choke slam a ref tonight!
Guess we will find out what life without Wenger is like for the next 3 games considering the things Wenger will say‚Ä¶ 
It's a fucking foul wenger you stupid coat cuntb
@ShiteSportsNews No time for either of them, but that's another non-pen against Arsenal! Wenger's gonna wear the zi‚Ä¶ 
I bet wenger saw that the triple a nonce jockey
Wenger is one bad ref decision away fae turning up to the FA offices way a semi automatic
Wenger is going to go nuts

@EtalePhilip haha....1-1 And the blues must get a winning goal!!! The stars Wenger promised you are the likes of Eden Hazard
Wenger is looking for you @LacazetteAlex
I don‚Äôt blame Wenger when he goes off about stuff like that
@KW04 Feel sorry for Wenger, twice in 3 days he's been robbed!
There‚Äôs a plot against Wenger 
Two of them went for a 50/50 ball, never a penalty! I bet the referees are against Arsene Wenger for having a go at‚Ä¶ 
And then they'll try ban grandad Wenger like say he's in the wrong to complain. Joke
Feel sorry for Wenger and Arsenal fans.

Wenger, in for a penny in for a pound, go for it, that was never a penalty
Never a penalty again, Wenger is getting no luck this week. ü§£
Wenger is twitching üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Being bossed by Wenger of all managers is a sackable offense.
Stone wall as well Wenger can‚Äôt moan

Referees testing Wenger's patience game after game üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wenger has done something to these referees.
@TiredTroglodyte Get Debuchy too after Wenger crushed his dreams
If Wenger gets a stadium ban, can Bellerin keep him company?
The FA owe Wenger an apology, not a ban. Two games spoiled by awful decisions.
That  penalty was the FA saying fuck you to wenger
Officials clearly have it out for Wenger. Need an internal investigation @FIFAcom
Can someone put the audio of @MrDtAFC on goon tv over a Wenger press conference please.
We deserved a pen and now they got one for free. People still saying Wenger is bullshitting but he‚Äôs fucking right
If Wenger stopped critising refs, maybe we would not concede penalties for nothing.
"Arsene Wenger having a good moan to the fourth official (who can do nothing) about a Chelaea penalty. 

Wonder how‚Ä¶ "
Arsenal robbed twice in a week. Got to feel for wenger
Naaah I‚Äôm blaming Wenger. Wenger our!!
When will Wenger accepts that Bellerin is a fraud. That guy has been the worst player I have seen in an Arsenal shirt.
Wenger lay into referee‚Äôs again!!! Extend the ban and defend this club.

Worlds against Wenger. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

If Wenger goes out murdering a referee it wouldn't be the worst thing. These penalties man... #ARSvsCHE
Wenger is gonna be banned for these penalty decisions  #AFCvCFC
You‚Äôve got to feel for wenger with these last few penalty decisions against arsenal, some appalling refereeing decisions
"Wenger can get fucked the cunt; Was a clear pen against West Brom and was a clear pen tonight! Zip your coat back up and sit down ya prick"
Ahahaha Arsene wenger you fucking wanker fuck off
Wenger pacing a figure of 8 in his cage #ARSvsCHE
Do the premier league refs have a bet going to see who can irritate wenger the most this season. Never a penalty
I swear there‚Äôs a conspiracy against Arsenal and Wenger by these refs.... #afc #arsenal #SameOldChelseaAlwaysCheatinf
Blatant penalty, but Wenger will complain about it anyway, undermining legit complaints about the one WBA got.
Wenger go fi fight plus the ref today.  Epl refs and their inconsistencies SMH.
Arsene wenger is haunted.  Please just leave ffs. The FA hates you
Arsenal and Wenger are the unluckiest club/manager I‚Äôve EVER EVER EVER SEEN. This drama happens almost every game!!‚Ä¶ 
@MrDtAFC Wenger already has a reason now
"""Arsene Wenger infruriated"" words from the commentator! "
Another soft pen. At least there was contact. Wenger will be doing his nut. Two in a week!! #ARSCHE
Why not being an Arsenal fan, can't help but feel sorry for wenger for being on the end of another appalling refereeing decision
@Mojss_A Too cheap Wenger will complain fire
"Here‚Äôs a conspiracy theory: This is a coup and the refs are being used to overthrow Wenger 
#ARSvsCHE "
Officials in the epl just want to give Wenger blood pressure men Fuck off that was no penalty
Just said wouldn't it be funny if Chelsea got a dodgy penalty now, and wenger would lose the plot and it happens üòÇüòÇ
That is ANOTHER utterly outrageous penalty decision. I hope Wenger goes utterly mental at the @fa. Disgusting referring. #Arsenal
Arsenal in three minutes went from sixth to fifth. Then back to sixth again. Well done Wenger.
@premierleague ..the defense of the Arsenal very bad ... Wenger should look for good defenders!
U pple will not kill Wenger before his time #arsche

"Wenger will moan about that and be asked about Wilshere and say ""I didnt see it"""
After everything Wenger said this week and everything that's gone on with Dean and Taylor still pulls this bullshit...
Wenger will wait until 4 min is left and then bring on a few player and expect the game to change instantly
Chambers really out of his depth here but Wenger totally to blame with lack of defensive coaching.
#ArsChe Wenger is so getting  this touchline ban after that cheap penalty by the ref. I mosdef won't blame Wenger if he complains.
Anthony Taylor couldn't wait to give that penalty. @fa. The anti-wenger vendetta #arsenal #ARSCHE
One day, Wenger will sha leave us forever and it'll be one of the happiest days of my life:
"Arsene Wenger may have been onto something when he talked about the trend of bad officiating.

It's almost as if th‚Ä¶ "
Haha so funny seeing that sore loser Wenger fume again, the one against WBA other day may not of been a pen but mak‚Ä¶ 
Its like Arsenal is caused, wenger has to leave. Maybe the cause would be lifted.
Oh dear Mr #Wenger should wiltshire be on the pitch blatant dive. Then another controversial peno #ARSCHE
Media won‚Äôt report Cesc getting that reception, just destroy Wenger again for getting irate about that ridiculous penalty
Yo wenger dont bother chat to anyone after the game
"@ESPNFC The referee gave Chelsea a fake penalty 
They will fine Wenger again.this time the referee should be question"
I'm wanting another penalty against Arsenal then I can really watch Wenger explode #Karma
Pretty sure AFTV have paid the refs to keep giving penalties against Arsenal to make Wenger resign. #ARSCHE
They want to use Penalties to injure Wenger
Wenger should go all in on the FA and the ref's again. Just extend that touchlinr ban fuck it, just rip into them once again
It's official, they want Arsene Wenger out of the UK.
Clear penalty Wenger didn't fully unzip his coat.  #ARSCHE
@TassierrY Cech can never save a penalty, Arsenal‚Äôs defenders are so god damn slow and crap, if wenger doesn‚Äôt buy defenders IÔ∏è cba.
@YankeeGunner Wenger's treatment of the officials, reasonable grievances or not, have bought Arsenal zero benefit o‚Ä¶ 
What Wenger is doing with Maitland-Niles, what Conte is doing with Christesen...am impressed #AFCvCFC

Wenger won‚Äôt leave Arsenal till he‚Äôs 6ft under so yhh I hope he dies soon
I feel another ban for Wenger coming up #arsenal
It‚Äôs worth remembering how desperate wenger was to get rid of jack üò≠üò≠
Hope Wenger goes out in a blaze of glory by flying a plane into FA HQ
Wenger, it's time to take off Lacazette abeg.
Conte wants to lose this game, he's trying so hard to be Wenger's bitch
Wenger needs to rip into the FA again. Take the 10 match ban
Only i know what Wenger is going through rn
Wenger looks like he goes to Kingsmead bruv
Don‚Äôt see the issue with the pen. Wenger can‚Äôt complain about ref when Wilshire should have gone for 2nd yellow (dive)
Wenger will be doing his nut, another dodgy penalty given against Arsenal
Spicy Wenger gets More and more feisty in his old age 
"@SamanthaQuek How bad is the standard of refereeing? Not a penalty.
Wenger might as well go for a longer ban and fu‚Ä¶ "
I'm sure Wenger will criticize that penalty decision. However, he needs to tell his players to be calm in the box.‚Ä¶ 
Hope Wenger loses it and twats the ref today. He's already getting banned, so may as well extend it.
Wenger gotta double down on the shitty refereeing tonight
#bbcfootball Wenger has a point. Watford and West Brom. penalties and now this. That's 6 points down the drain.
These Ref's are trying to get Wenger fired I see. It's a conspiracy.
Take out Chambers . Are you so fucking slow in your head Wenger ???
The facial expressions of the guy beside wenger üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

@TrayOnline4 Wenger needs to cuss the ref again blud, part 2 fire in the booth

At this rate Wenger won't just get a stadium ban, the FA will deport him!
I think Wenger is right @arseblog There is a conspiracy against him and the club.
Wenger really does have a face like a sniff of gas
Wenger lifetime ban incoming

@maxrushden Is there an underground 'Fight Club' style organisation of referees plotting against Wenger? Lines open at 10 am
@piersmorgan How long before Wenger goes Piers?  Do you think he'll still be there this time tomorrow?
Wenger may as well drop kick the ref after the game, he is getting a ban anyways
The Conte - Wenger show on the touchline is a game within the game.
Honestly Wenger has to start spinning jaws SOMEONE GRIP UP HAZARD
Referees too now want Wenger out/gone.
If Arsenal lose this game Wenger‚Äôs ban might be for the remainder of the season ü§£ü§£ #ARSCHE
Feel bad for Wenger because he‚Äôll get slated for not winning this match (If they don‚Äôt) when it‚Äôs not at all his wrong doing #ARSCHE
Wenger should pull the Mourinho nothing to say after the game.
@Arsenal the defense of the Arsenal very bad ... Wenger should look for good defenders
Wenger should let Sanchez leave this left side a bit abeg.. Let him roam right and central a bit biko
@DrunkVoltron How bad is Wenger going to go off on the refs again today?
#bbcfootball you have to feel for Arsenal and Wenger. Second game in a row a controversial penalty is awarded against us.
Think Wenger should go all out and point out the refs incompetence today as well
These young defenders are naive. Wenger needs proper defenders. He keeps buying these teenagers hoping they develop‚Ä¶ 
Bellerin is a waste of space. I don‚Äôt know why Wenger even plays this guy, he is shit.
Never a pen @BarryEdwardsJr @Doyle_liam Wenger will be good value after this!
@bartuayi Draw at the Emirates would be a credible result? Against Mr Wenger!
Na I can't wait for wenger to lose it
So the @FA plan is to keep making shit calls against Arsenal till Wenger plays nice. FOFF FA #Arsenal Gunners for life
Arsene Wenger should just go and beat every motherfucking referee out there now.
Can‚Äôt wait to hear what Wenger has to say this time ü§≠
Does wenger not know he‚Äôs allowed 3 subs????
It is a fact that all the referees are against Wenger this season 
Woahhh. I hope Wenger doesn't introduce Alex Iwobi. The lad plays like he's in a academy 
@Gunner_vision and yet wenger cant complain or hes fkn hit with a ban its fucking invelievable
Wenger has a face that looks like it needs a slap

@TOTK96 no way will wenger let him come to us! he would rather him go on a free! alexis would come to us to play uc‚Ä¶ 
if Mourinho speaks out on bad officiating like Wenger and Pep do he gets a ban or fine. nice to be liked by the FA hey
I hope Wenger gives the ref a powerbomb #AFCvCFC
@charlieflynn900 @Arsenal Wenger look when he says erm lol
@ArsenalNexus Wenger gets not respect. The refs dont like or respect him. Ferguson would never experience such
"Mike Dean: I love boiling Wenger's piss.
Anthony Taylor: Hold my beer...."
@ELEGBETE1 Thank you Boss. He is the major reason arsenal concede so many goals. I will blame  Wenger though for celebrating mediocrity
Arsenal conceding two soft pens in 3 days. Wenger running mad imminent.
Wenger should just catch a body. No ways
Wenger going to get a touchline ban anyway , may aswell spark Anthony Taylor out and be done with it 
Wenger to take off Lacazette for Welbeck when we need to win
"Yet another #pen given against #Arsenal ....at this rate #Wenger will go grey &amp; pay the #FA a fortune lol üòÇ #PremierLeague ‚öΩ"
A ref could do a penis windmill in front of Arsenal's bench and Wenger would get fined and banned for criticizing it afterwards.
@SkySportsPL Wenger not knowing how to react to pen hilarious! Proper mr bean!
Why don‚Äôt Wenger Out Sanchez on?
Never thought we'd hold onto our lead. We're the more fatigued of the two. Need to not lose it now. Subs please Mr Wenger.
Odds that Wenger saw the Hazard dive but missed the Wilshere one, anyone??. Odds on the FA having the balls to ban‚Ä¶ 
Wenger should pull out lacazette abeg
Wenger needs to find a new system.. we are better offensively with 352 but too exposed defensively..!
Would love Wenger to lose it and go for the ref proper
Anything to get rid of Wenger. For good. #Arsenal
Arsene Wenger constantly looks like he‚Äôs heard someone talking about him
@OfficialMgh He never lost it, Wenger just didn't give him he's chance

Penalty against Arsenal? Mmm . Wonder what Arsene Wenger will be talking about post-match.

Wenger is always furious with the officials
I'd be extending my ban if I was wenger

Wenger needs to make a positive change to lift us. Welbeck for Lacazette or something
I guess another FA charge for Wenger is incoming. Match officials are against us.
@stephdufc83 Always worth it for Wenger‚Äôs interviews though

"@MrRichiy Yea, that's the effect of Wenger's trust.

I'm not a fan of the lad though. He's just sound with the basics IMO."
Sub Lacazette na. Why is Wenger so clueless? Bring on Welbeck or Giroud to nip some of these crosses.
Wenger is waiting for Chinise new year to make changes
Bald referees always hating on wenger like how can he be that old with all that hair on his  head...

Arsene Wenger should substitute Cech whenever we concede a penalty.
Welp. Wenger realized Laca played his 70 minutes and now he‚Äôs gonna get yanked.

WTF is wrong with Wenger? Why does he keep taking of Laca? Come on mate
OMG wenger you bastard. you can't let laca play 90min?
Why Wenger is so against Laca playing 90mins I do not know
Arsene Wenger will no doubt slaughter Hazard and the referee for the penalty, and rightly so, but will he slaughter‚Ä¶ 
What at all does wenger see in welbeck?
I want Wenger to go full on Michael Douglas in Falling Down on the PGMOL.

I dont get why Wenger constantly subs Lacazette off, why doesnt Wenger play two up top, go for it
Lacazette should ask to be traded. He doesn't deserve this shit. Wenger has lost his mind.
Lmfao Wenger still persisting with replacing Lacazette
Wenger might just be banned from football after the post match press conference.
@paddypower Wenger whinge
What did Lacazette do to Wenger please?!

For gods sake Wenger let lacazette play a full 90 mins

Honestly,fuck Wenger
Every single game Wenger takes off lacazette, no wonder no one wants to play for him twat
Why is this wenger guy taking him off for welbeck that‚Äôs ridiculous 
"Alexis Sanchez has barely touched the football this half and it's Lacazette that comes off ?!.. Is Wenger mad ?!

Surely Wenger will go out tomorrow and sign a proper centre half to replace Chambers ? Shocking.

Just joined in and I saw Arsenal conceding a penalty with Wenger fuming lol
Why take Laca off againnnnnn ffs Wenger
There must be a financial reason or clause that is making Wenger to replace Lacazette at every game. Doesn't make sense #ARSvsCHE

@saurxbh Wenger re..kay substitutions karto raoüòî

Just what they need! Classic Wenger. 
Lacazette is the black Juan Mata. He hardly ever gonna complete 90 mins for Wenger.
Why the hell does Wenger always take off Lacazette man makes no sense
No Wenger. This was THE game where you leave Lacazette on for 90 mins. He's been lively and involved in majority of‚Ä¶ 
Blimey, Wenger gets more fixed penalties than a DHL driver. #afc #AFCvCFC #ARSvsCHE

LMFAO Wenger oha panyouka etse.
We could have Ronaldo and Wenger would sub him off for welbeck smh
Wenger has offended EPL refs!!! Lmao!!!
Subbing Lacazette come like a drug to Wenger
Imagine taking off Lacazette for Welbeck. L @wenger
Lacazzette banged Wenger's dish or what ? This is not normal!!

What does Wenger gain from bringing on Welbeck? Every time and it's never paid off
Yes Wenger take a man off who can finish and replace him with Danny ‚Äúcan‚Äôt hit the broad side of a barn‚Äù Welbeck
Wenger has actually managed to find a reason to take laca off for Welbeck with 10 minutes to go
We need a goal and we're taking a striker off. Wenger's fucking finished
Laca needs to slap Wenger, keeps on subbing him out lmaoo

Wenger to our defenders in half time talk ,here lads take 2 each 
Wenger wants to end Chambers career.
@thesackrace Good GIF, it‚Äôs when Mr Bean watches his car get crushed by a tank. A bit like Wenger watching Arsenal‚Äôs season.
Arsene wenger please drop Hector bellerin from the starting line up. He is tired and too non challant

"@MrUbochi It's as if Wenger forgot all about Montero and thought, ""yo, putting him here should be alright, it's never worked badly before"""
Sean Dyche should replace Wenger at Arsenal. In my honest opinion. IMHO.

@ArsenalFanTV Wenger needs to give chambers an earful and change the formation Asap  !!!
What exactly did Wenger say at half-time to make Palace look like Barca at the start of the second half? #CRYARS
You're telling me Arsene Wenger is getting outmanouvered by Roy Hodgson??? Wow this man. What a man.

Dear Wenger ,get that Chambers out!
@heathy1990 He's class mate if only Wenger had abit more faith in him rather than sending him out on loan
"Wenger needs to stop talking  about ""values"" and start looking at his tactics."
I liked a @YouTube video  Arsene Wenger has had an indelible impact on PL
"@Arsenal tell Wenger to switch Koscielny and Chambers around, so obvious that Palace are targeting Chambers &amp; Bellerin."
Why don't you try to stand up and reorganize this sh*t, Wenger?
I want to see Wenger furiously throw a water bottle. #CRYARS 
Wenger sat there as usual doing fuckall to motivate the players or making no changes to influence the game. Time to go old man #wengerout

@AfcConnor10 Watch wenger bring iwobi on now
@DonTomasClark @kkfla737 Exactly. Also what has wenger done that other managers have not tbh?? Other than being immune to the sack??
Wenger really should have done something about the Zaha/Chambers problem at half time. the left wing is being exploited
It's nearly 2018 and some Arsenal fans still think things will be different under Wenger. Can't relate.
@RichieTheHorse I agree and it's gone on for far too long especially with Arsene Wenger out staying his welcome.

@WideCreator would love to see it, wenger doesn‚Äôt have the cojones
I do love Wenger. He needs a velcro mac, bless him.
@aliladiere Wenger plays him consistently knowing this exact fact. Alexis will always try the exceptional pass or t‚Ä¶ 
@bilko2805 he‚Äôll be crying now, any reason for wenger to be praised annoys him
We like to act like it was only Wenger who had this bogus vision of a British core. Ake, Loftus-Cheek and Solanke w‚Ä¶ 
@WelBeast And still not given him a contract. Wenger needs to sign him in
@GiroudesqueZ Fat Roy twerking for Wenger
Your beloved Wenger let them run their contracts down! #dick RT @ArsenalGuvnor Jack and Ozil in midfield, joy to watch! Sign them up!!
Maitland-Niles shows promise but Wenger must get to grips with Arsenal defence  
If Wenger takes Jack out the team when Ramsey is back then idgaf I'm taking him out
810 games and Arsene Wenger still can‚Äôt master the zipper. Very telling. #CRYARS 
@piersmorgan @JackWilshere Wenger in?!
@BobbyB500 I fucking love wenger üòÇ
@premierleague Wenger will party tonight  
#CPFCvAFC really don't know why Wenger plays Ramsey ahead of Wilshire, I also believe monreal will be better than kolasinac at left wing
@piersmorgan @JackWilshere Look at that head swell , fuck me we might not get a wenger moan tonight out of  #Piersmorgan
"Once Aaron Ramsey is fit once again, I bet Wenger will be benching Jack Wilshere again.....

Ramsey has Wenger‚Äôs nudes....!!"
Wilshere has to be first choice centre mid the way he‚Äôs playing at the min no doubt Wenger will drop him when Ramsa‚Ä¶ 
Make Wenger go bring back Ramsey replace wilshere for this team la s√°n...I will swear for his father #AFC
Said Arsene Wenger to @Arsenal 
Lmao Arsenal on a good run? Can't wait till they lose and draw and start saying Wenger Out
Wenger is fried for wanting Wilshere to play in the front 3 btw
I know Wenger so well that even after the performances Wilshere has put in I can bet my house that he reverts back‚Ä¶ 
Wenger was so clever with the way he brought wilshere back to first team football üî¥üî¥üî¥
@d_c_lynn Absolutely I‚Äôm a Wenger fan..I‚Äôd take 20 years stability over a rollercoaster ride any day,
@kosigerryofor Fucking bastard wenger is gonna find one way or the other
@ltarsenal 8 Wenger still needs to go
"We're 2-1 up at Palace. Best thing about that is Wenger has coached the team in how to shut up shop &amp; keep a lead!‚Ä¶ "
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger felt sorry for Sol Campbell  #Rumours #Mercato #Transfer 
Do you think City would notice if we sold them Wenger instead of Sanchez? ü§î
Wenger out ! Arsenal playing some great stuff beggars belief that some  of their fans moan
Lacazette is bout to be sent off by Wenger like it‚Äôs high school and you got to let the the other kids play smh
Mister. Wenger. Has. Done. It. Again.
@KemziLinzi Boi it ruff..but pree seh Wenger is Arsenal and Arsenal is Wenger...
Bet Wenger brings Coquelin on!!!
Arsene Wenger wanted to sell our Jack Wilshere 
Wenger will ultimately sell, cause surely he can't walk away at the end of the season and we get nothing. 
wenger should rest ozil aoody
Wenger asking for pressure in the last 15 mins by bringing coq on
@WeahsCousin Thought that when they did a combined age of Wenger and Hodgson. It's weird
#CRYARS Wenger sitting pretty right now. Very rarely we are in such a position. Must enjoy every sec of it!
Look at Wilshere and Xhaka....now imagine Wenger using his brain and buying a proper DM to play behind them
On this momentuous night for Arsene Wenger, we're asking: what was the best team performance of Wenger's reign?‚Ä¶ 
Get in closed the gap to 21 points hope they give Wenger an extension! üòç #COYG
@brfootball The Wenger Out banner üòÇ
Wenger must sign a proper DM and get Wilshere and Ramsey in the team together in a midfield 3. Would be devastating
Record 810 Premier League games in charge but Wenger still can't master that zip - #soccer #Fifa #football... 
@premierleague @Alexis_Sanchez Wenger‚Äôs faith in @Alexis_Sanchez is paying off #COYG
wenger should rest ozil aiidy
@dazzyd001 So Wenger needs to get better coaches in?
Wenger doesn‚Äôt stand up even when he‚Äôs losing.

Wenger always manages to take Lacazette off it's sooooo frustrating
He managed to sub-off Lacazette still lmfaoooo Wenger is consistent.
Fuck off Wenger .... the lad needs confidence and you sub him off every 70mins
I've come to the conclusion that Wenger's changes are very inappropriate and vexing üò©üòÇ
@Arsenal @WengerOut_Bot Asshole Wenger substitutes lacca with that idiot Coq who must have given him the best blow job
I'm laughing Wenger has Laca and his fanboys on strings üòÇüò≠üòÇüò≠
Wenger is pissing me off
Jesus Christ Wenger let the man get 90 fucking minutes
Wenger does anything to keep that palm tree cunt happy, but always subs off Laca, does my head in, daft cunt
Lacazette subbed off again. Wenger you utter prick.
"Lacazette not happy at all, I still don't understand why Wenger never gives his main striker a full game, killing his confidence 
#CRYARS"
Will Wenger have malaria if Lacazette plays 90 mins? @Arsenal #CRYARS
He will thank Wenger come the World Cup and he is still fresh as a daisy
wenger is just destroying laca‚Äôs confidence
Actually Wenger doesn‚Äôt let him finish the game
Lacazette I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not us it‚Äôs wenger, we all love you ‚ù§Ô∏è@LacazetteAlex
Arsene Wenger has absolutely no idea how to deal with Lacazette. So highly rated and yet, is always one of the firs‚Ä¶ 
why the fuck does Wenger do this.
Wenger amazes me every week, no other club in the fucking world would sub off their star player EVERY FUCKING GAME.‚Ä¶ 
Stupid Wenger Crystal palace known for late goals and you take off Lacazette poor substitution
Wenger going defensive. Which he never used to do and got slated will now get slated for doing it. Good sub in my opinion #CRYARS
Why does Wenger keep doing this to Lacazette?
That was disgusting from Wenger.
Fuck wenger. Always Lacazette
Wenger doesn't really like Lacazzete
Wtf is Wenger doing taking Lacazette off? Like Mourinho taking Martial off lmao
Wenger doesn‚Äôt want to see Lacazette shine!!!
That idiot is on. Another terrible sub from Wenger.
Na man this old fuck Wenger violates Lacazette too much
Why does wenger take off his club record signing, but leave on 2 players who don't want to be at the club on the pitch...? #arsenal #CRYARS
Wenger , please stop taking off Lacazette every game too early! JFC
Wtf is wrong with wenger
Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questions Arsene Wenger decision again #Arsenal #AFC #Gooners #COYG #FNH

FFS Wenger man!
One of these days Lacazette is gonna bang Wenger in the face as he's walking off to the bench
Wenger wrote down his subs from home.

Fuck sake Wenger, give the man 90 fucking minutes for fuck sake! #Laca #WengerOut #Arsenal
Why does Wenger have this obsession of subbing Lacazette off around the 75th minute? #CPFCvAFC
FFS. Why is Wenger taking Laca off every fuckin game. Let him bag a goal you old fart. You can see the frustration on his face!
Wenger is frustrating Lacazette. Let the man finish a game. He hustled through out the game only to be substituted‚Ä¶ 
Fuck off Wenger taking off laca
Wenger has turned the Lacazette 70 minute sub into a habit more than actually having logical thinking behind it it‚Ä¶

Again Wenger too scared to sub off ozil and Sanchez so takes off lacazette Cos he‚Äôs humble. Prick.
Lol.. Why is Wenger always substituting Lacazette. smh
Just for subbing off Lacazette on the 75th minute I'd like to say once more - WENGER OUT
"Lacazette for Coquelin? 
Only Wenger, smh. #Arsenal"
Wenger is like that father who just keeps punishing you for been good but not the best . Taking off Lacazzete off all the time üò°üò°üò°üò°#AFC
Breaks my heart each time Lacazette is taken off. Wenger is a certified sadist
Lacazette needs to actually punch Wenger up
Lacazette was decent today considering he was feeding off scraps. Understand him being frustrated. Wenger over protecting him?
Wenger making another bizarre decision #lacazette
Can wenger start letting lacazette finish matches for fuck sake
Wenger can cut out this whole Lacazette off at 70th/75th min bollocks as well
Lacazette off again. Christ I hate Wenger
Wenger really knows how to frustrate someone. Laca is supposed to be scorung goals, which he cant if HE KEEPS GETTING SUBBED OFF.
Even with Giroud injured Laca can‚Äôt complete 90 minutes. I hate Wenger so much.
Lacazette is Wenger out
Why does Wenger have to take off Lacazette at all costs?
What has our 9 done to Wenger??
Wenger is a fool
Wenger get problem 
Why is he taking of Lacazette?  Bro I hate Wenger üò≠üò≠üò≠
Brahh. Wenger has to go 
@samuelJayC I dont understand wenger. Now giroud is absent. U still subbed off d guy.
This wenger guy is a real crackhead
Sad to see Wenger pull off the striker again. He's so good.
Lacazette pissed off yet again, Wenger needs to keep him on side ffs
Why is Wenger being such a constant cunt with Lacazette
Really don‚Äôt know why Wenger keeps taking off Laca and pissing him off? Let him stay on and try get a goal ffs
Lacazette has to beat up Wenger
WENGER YOU OLD FUCKING CUNT YOURE GOING TO MAKE HIM DEPRESSED WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU WHY THE FUCK DID HE TAKE OFF LACA
Wenger has an issue with Laca
ffs Wenger what is this sub
Let Laca get a goal Wenger.
@afcstuff Wenger doing everything to please Sanchez.
Lacazette has to knock out Wenger this cannot continue
You're taking off Lacca instead of Ozil? Wenger you're mad
I really hate this Wenger guy. Let your bloody striker get a goal!
Wengers a dick head for taking off lacazette every match. Soon he‚Äôll want to leave as well because of that cunt Wenger #CPFCvAFC
"Laca needs to go knock Wenger‚Äôs door &amp; speak that Oui Oui &amp; ask him why he‚Äôs not getting full 90 mins."
Wenger needs to stop taking Lacazette off
Wenger reminding me why I want him gone
No Giroud. Sub Lacazette with Defensive Midfield. Fakof Wenger.
@durrellb Hate Wenger when he brings off Lacazette like that.
It‚Äôs like he wants to rest Laca for an upcoming UCL game tomorrow. Wenger sometimes is just a twat!!
3-1 up and he‚Äôs taken off Lacazette. Wenger isn‚Äôt fucking reyt.
Wenger really is a tosser
the fuck???? Lacazette off for Coquelin... What the hell Wenger. It's not like you've run Lacazette dead this seaso‚Ä¶ 
Mann... Fuck you Wenger
Wenger is one dumbfuck
Wenger takes Lacazette off again. What is he trying to do to him!!!!!
Wenger taking Lacazette off for Coquelin leaves the same taste in my mouth as being 8-0 down
"Lacazette would make a very good support striker,he has all the tools. 
Not sure Wenger can currently coach a two striker system though."
I don‚Äôt get why Wenger keeps taking Laca off. He‚Äôs just taking the mick now
Wenger has judt proved he knows nothing... he is killing Lacazette's confidence by substituting him out. #CRYARS
"Takes off a player who wants to stay and leaves a player on who wants to leave.
Ladies n gentlemen Its Wenger time"
Wenger such an idiot why the fuck does he always remove Lacazette üò§üòà #COYG
What does Wenger have against Laca playing 90 mins lol?
Lacazzatte isn't happy with what Wenger is doing to him #COYG
Fuck you Wenger.
Brilliant Wenger just  brilliant lacazzette off again for coquelin more goals in this and we take our 9 off !
"Lacazette scored 31 goals in the final 20 minutes of a game, for Lyon.

Wenger is honestly losing the plot."
I absolutely dislike the way Wenger always brings off Lacazette. He was very instrumental in those two first goals. Classic no 9!!!
Fuck Off from @Arsenal Wenger!
"Why has #Wenger taken @LacazetteAlex off? ü§Ø

#CRYARS"
Can Wenger stop taking Lacazette off. Let your number 9 have the chance to score goals
Wenger changing @LacazetteAlex is a fucking banter.
Wenger is a dickhead man
Don‚Äôt agree with Wenger continually subbing #lacazette. Killing his confidence. He looks so unhappy. Especially whe‚Ä¶ 
Oloshi ni Wenger yi.. .  Let Lacazettet play now.
On another note I hate how Wenger is treating Lacazette fucking prick taking him off all the time
Wenger Crazy I swear.
Lacazette has had enough of being brought off every fucking game, and rightly so. Fuck off Wenger
Well done wenger, keep playing xhaka and bellerin but piss off lacazette each game
Wenger you need to stop pissing @LacazetteAlex off with this periodic substitution? What dat?!üò° @Arsenal
Wenger taking out his best striker (who needs a goal for morale boost) for a defensive midfielder, when he's up 3-1? LOL
Why in the fuck is wenger keen on not playing lacazette all game? Ffs stop playing Alexis over Alexandre
@nic_bucco Poor Laca man Wenger got no fucking clue he is unbelievable
Wenger‚Äôs treatment of Lacazette is disgusting
Arsene Wenger when Lacazette thinks he'll play the whole 90 minutes. 
Has Wenger been asked in any of his pressers why he takes Laca off early all the time?
Wenger needs to fuck off im tired of this man bullshit subs.
Wenger why do you do this to lacazette man ffs
Why does Wenger like bringing Lacazette off?
I‚Äôm sick of wenger... I‚Äôm a game where lacazette needs to build confidence you take him off for a disaster of a CDM‚Ä¶ 
@cwilbzim @brfootball Wow. Was Blonde Wenger a champion?
stop bringing him offfff wenger!!!!
@arseblog Trying to make Sanchez happy by playing him up top and sub off the one who are willing to fight for the team. Genius Wenger
I'm sick and tired of Wenger smh
To be fair, if Lacazette would get injured I would never forgive Wenger for not taking him off.
Please what did Lacazette do to Wenger? I don't really understandthese constant substitutions!
Removing lacazette isnt necessary in this game...  Wenger is just too predictable
Martin Tyler spitting fire tonight.  Relentlessly ripping into Benteke, and now rips into Wenger for not understand‚Ä¶ 
Fuck you wenger why sub him what has he done wrong?
wenger  ur pops for bringing off laca
What the fuck is wrong with Arsene Wenger.... we dnt need a DM now....we need more goals jonkey Wenger#AFC
Wenger out here wasting Lacazette. So irritating.
Arsene Wenger bores me sometimes with his substitutions
Wenger so trash, b.  smhhhhhh
Whatever Lacazette did to Wenger.
I‚Äôm getting so mad with Wenger
Wenger bringing Lacazette off before the end of the game, again. ü§¨
Wenger is a piece of shit
Wenger should be put in a mental institution honestly... I just don't understand the fool 
Wenger sale chien.
@peltonboy Wenger did that just for you mate so you would have something to moan about
Lacazette is very much frustrated for taking him off. Can I know why on earth Wenger always substitute him when we're in a good position?
@samuelJayC Wenger must be really hate watching laca play fulltime
Wenger hates Laca doesn‚Äôt he? 
"Arsene Wenger is always sub'ing Lacazette and this is pissing me off nxah....

#WengerOut"
WTF IS WRONG WITH WENGER?! Whyyyy are you taking Lacazette off?!
Wenger has managed to get lacazette's confidence right down to the lowest possible point. Absolutely stupid to never let him finish a game.
Why don't Wenger like Lacazette
@ani_ela_ Mesef  Wenger dey fear ozil or wat he has been crap in this game
Wenger's reasons for substitutions only understood by him alone.......
Poor old lacazette. Why does Wenger always take him off!!? ¬£56 million for 3 full minutes!! Wenger  is losing the fucking plot!!
"I genuinely feel sorry for @LacazetteAlex Wenger is dickhead

Can you pls stop fucking taking lacazette off wenger... pls!!!! I fucking hate you and your family
Wenger with another stupid move taking Lacazette off üôÑ
Why does Wenger keep subbing off Lacazette?! He‚Äôs gonna leave by the end of the season at this point because he doesn‚Äôt play.
Wenger needs to cut it out wit removing laca every single game..wtf dude ain‚Äôt happy at all..
Laca only plays epl football so why does wenger keeping subbing himüò°üò°
@Coutinho10i Lmao you think Wenger cares
Wenger is clueless on how soccer works in 2017
"Games thick and fast, with only one fit striker to genuinly trust. 

Wenger right to take him off"
Lacazette plays poorly you take him off he plays well u take him off he has no contribution you take him off WENGER you‚Äôre a BASTARD!!!!
@Arsenal arsene Wenger is a boring manager.
Wenger needs to play him for the full 90
Lmao free lacazette now Wenger ugh!
@Barcaificent The disrespect lol two assists still, Wenger has no shame
Coach #Wenger of #Arsenal afraid to leave his striker #Lacazette on the field with a 3-1 lead This is how far Arsenal has fallen

Pissed at Wenger again...Sanchez is leaving take him off...Laca needs the mins and a goal #FPL #UTA
@touchlinefracas Lacazette must be Wenger Out by now, subbed off again
@Bimzee_ wenger has serious issues honestly
Strikers need goals and Wenger is preventing that
Now see this is where Mr Wenger does my head in. Lacazette not injured. Win the game by six. Why not? Btw I'm not q‚Ä¶ 
@ffarsenalfc Even worse.. puts on Coq when Laca needs to score... fuck off Wenger. #wengerout #cryars
Wenger already fucking up Lacazette at Arsenal
Wenger and Conte have a habit of taking they star players off
DT will commit hate crimes v Wenger on AFTV tonight
Wenger is the only manager in the league who would take lacazette off at 75 mins its becoming a fucking joke
Lacazette must be so sick and tired of wenger subbing he as 70 mins hit
Wenger please let #lacazette got damn finish the freaking game would ya? #CRYARS
Wenger took out lacazette with an entire 20 minutes left in the game. Bruh 
Wenger is an absolute fucking idiot why take off Lacazette, you can tell how pissed off he was
"#CRYARS
Arsenal go defensive | lacazette is off for coquelin. a good move my Arsene Wenger to hang on to his precio‚Ä¶ "
Why take off Lacazette.... Does Wenger enjoy frustrating players?
Wenger I beg you! Don't make Lacazette regret joining Arsenal...
Fucking idiot this Wenger. R u bloody sure he's a professor
Wenger needs to be careful he doesn't push Laca away, he gets so vexed every time he's taken off and rightly so
The commentator said Wenger doesn't understand his players mentally as per the Lacazette sub and I think I agree. W‚Ä¶ 
Wenger can‚Äôt just give lacazette a full game silly
Why does Wenger want to ruin Laca‚Äôs confidence üßê
What the f##k! Is Wenger high? Takes off the best player? #CPFCvAFC #GoonerFamily

@onlinechelle WHY TF WOULD YOU TAKE LACAZETTE OFF? WENGER IS PISSING ME OFF. DID HE NOT SEE HOW HEAVILY INVOLVED LA‚Ä¶ 
"Lacazette: giroud's injured I'll get 90 minutes now

BC WENGER
Lacazette‚Äôs going to leave with Sanchez and Ozil if Wenger keeps subbing him
@Arsenal @ArsenalFanTV @MrDtAFC why does Wenger take Lacazette every time #WengerOut old cunt
Lacazette must be Wenger out too because the way he's being treated doesn't make sense
Wenger‚Äôs behaving like I‚Äôm Laca‚Äôs contract it says if he gets 90 he can leave the club.
I'm telling you now if Wenger is Sri here in the summer Lacazette will ask for a transfer. He ain't gonna put up wi‚Ä¶

Why is Wenger always taking off Lacazette it's Sickening....@Arsenal #CRYARS
What in the world is wrong with Wenger? Can't he see how he's affecting Lacazette's mentality?
Main man Laca not happy. Rather lose Wenger than that gunman all day long
Wenger takes off Laca?! Why man? Why?! ü§î #CPFCvAFC
What Wenger is doing to Lacazette is not fair!
Hate how Wenger takes off lacazette so often
Fck Wenger honest to god bro. Laca is gonna leave arsenal sooner or later. He knows he made a mistake
Lacazette is pissed off already... Ffs Wenger man, just let him play the full game. Imagine signing a ¬£50m striker‚Ä¶ 
Lacazette is too humble, it's time he got touched at Wenger
Wenger would contact measles if he plays Lacazette for 90 minutes
Wenger is so annoying for subbing Lacazette off in each and every game. That shit should stay behind in 2017 üò†üò†üò†
I really don‚Äôt get why Wenger is still in charge of arsenal my guy is pass his expiring date now
Why can‚Äôt Wenger let Laccazette play
Slowly getting tired of Arsene Wenger..
Honestly Wenger why take off your main striker,nxl
Wenger is a fucking old cunt I hope when they fire him he goes broke
Arsene Wenger. Logic @Arsenal
Lacazette already hates Wenger.
Why is LACCA  off for f****** coquelin this is why we need Arsene Wenger gone PRICK
Wenger magic: 70+min..take off Lacazette....for Coquelinüòí
@gunnerblog Wenger is specialist in failure
I still maintain, buying #Lacazatte was never #Wenger‚Äôs decision. Always subbing him Always ü§¨. #CRYARS #Arsenal
Wenger has subbed off Lacazette again. What did this boy do to you? I'm tired
@MattyLouthAFC Taking off lacazette for coquelin get out wenger

Lacazette ladies and gentlemen.....just another player Arsene Wenger will ruin!!! Get that dinosaur out my club!!! #WengerOut
@Fekirinho Ars ars ars arsene wenger
Wenger doesn't want Lacazette to stat pad any goals this season smh
Wenger never makes a 70 minute sub when we're losing. But he just cannot resist taking lacazette off
Lacazette if Wenger keeps taking him off in the 70th minute 
Why the fuck does wenger keep taking lacazette off ffs
wenger needs to stop disrespecting lacazette like that
Good move by Wenger. Lacazette is our only decent striker and need him to start every game coming up. Can‚Äôt afford to have him injured
"Oh Wenger FFS

Why Laca? üò°"
Wenger at it again! How in the world would you sub Lacazette who's been energetic in running into space, holding up‚Ä¶ 
When you think Giroud will no longer sub Lacazette, Wenger found new means by replacing him with Coquelin! #CPFCvAFC #CRYARS
Wenger needs to play lacazette for the full 90mins. What rubbish is this?
Wenger is single handily killing lacca keep subbing the man off fucking why ya silly old cunt
Dear Wenger, if @LacazetteAlex has ever offended you pls forgive him. Can you please let him play 90mins? We're begging you.
Wenger is a block head! Let Lacazette play!
Arsene Wenger will come up with a fire formation n link up play against these small teams but go back straight to 4‚Ä¶ 
Arsene Wenger really needs to stop taking off @LacazetteAlex every game with 20/15mins left it's frustrating me can‚Ä¶ 
Wenger is the only reason Lacazette hasn't scored up to a dozen goals this season. I'm tired.
frustrating why Wenger took him off so often
Why doesn‚Äôt Lacazette get to finish a game!? F-sakes Wenger! He wants to play and wants to score goals! Really lost the plot. #Arsenal
Wenger again ? Why taking off @LacazetteAlex for what reason #CPFCvAFC
We need to do something about Wenger taking Lacazette off always. There needs to be a protest or something.It's not fair.It makes no sense.
@astur7 It's there. Wenger needs to cut that bullshit out.
What will Wenger do if Lacazette decides to leave in January due to the regular substitution? #CPFCvAFC
Instead of making a sub (taking off Xhaka for Coquelin), Wenger went for a change of formation: 3-5-2 with Sanchez‚Ä¶ 
@Arsenal WENGER U FRENCH MOTHERFUCKER CUNT.WHY DO U Always take off LACA.HOPE U FUCKEN DIE U FUCKHEAD.LEAVE NOW U P‚Ä¶ 
Maybe if Lacazette plays 90mins Wenger will get a heart attack üôÉ. #CRYARS
Poor from Wenger that imo... leave Lacazette on, man needs a goal a d does nothing for his confidence. Looks dejected walking off.
Why sub off Lacazetteüòíüòí Wenger is senile honestly
Poor man management by #Wenger. Why does he always take out @LacazetteAlex @Arsenal
@arsenalist and he just ripped into Wenger's handling of Lacazette. Tyler is on fire tonight. I'm loving it.
Wenger seriously fuck off.. Actually tryna ruin Lacazette kmt

Never seen a useless manager than Wenger. Your striker needs goals to boost his game yet while he is playing so wel‚Ä¶ 
Lacazette subbed AGAIN! Wenger FUCK OFF OUT OF MY CLUB!
Why take of Laca every time Wenger ffs
Giroud gets injured but that doesn‚Äôt stop Wenger finding a Frenchman to replace Lacazette on the pitch
Why take Laca off.üòî WTF Wenger.
"This bastard Wenger will chase this Lacazette boy away with these substitutions. 
Remove another person na...Wilshere...Xhaka ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

@arseblog Glad to finally see Lacazette looking pissed off everytime Wenger leaves on players who want to leave and takes him off.
"Wenger needs to keep Ozil &amp; Sanchez happy, can't touch them.  So it's poor laca everytime he needs someone off from the front 3 #CRYARS"
Wenger knows best. 
Wenger na mumu with this sub
Wenger always spoiling my RAB by always taking Lacazette off @ 70 mins.
@gunnerblog @slovenianGooner I bet Wenger didn‚Äôt take him off because of the next game
Why Wenger hates Laca so much I don't know 
Wrong move Wenger
For once I understand Wenger taking off Lacazette. Needs to rest him for Sunday. No reserve striker with Giroud out
An open tweet to Mr Wenger,          Will you pay @Alexis_Sanchez whatever he demands. Mr Kronke is loaded.
"Arsenal fans: How can you replace Lacazette for Coquelin in a game like this? 

Wenger: "
Why does Wenger take off lacazette and piss him off for, once again, not giving him a full game when he can sub off‚Ä¶ 
"Wenger, what the fuck are you doing?! Sub off Lacazette again?!

WTF has @LacazetteAlex  got to do to finish 90 minutes under Wenger 
Am soo over Wenger taking off Lacazette all the damn time. #CRYARS
What does Wenger have against Laca honestly? Man never finishes a game. And bringing on coq is just taking the piss
Wenger taking off Laca @ the 70 minute mark every game is so frustrating for me I know Laca is pissed. I don‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ 
Wth Lacazette off for Coqueline ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶ one of this days, Wenger should really hope he doesn't see me face to face
Lacazette looks pissed again Wenger needs to stop this
Why do Conte and Wenger hate their attackers so much? Laca and Hazard get subbed at 70 mins every week.
@don_jidz He hated Wenger I know it
@inremotepart Wenger does this all the time. I understand this tactic but he's been great up top!
Wenger dinosaur manager #wengerout and quickly or Lacazette will be next to leave

@GoonerViews I‚Äôd be pissed too.. don‚Äôt screw this up wenger. He‚Äôs too good
Lacazette is visibly disappointed. Why does Wenger keep subbing him off everytime
Wenger must be watching a different game. What did Lacazette need to do more to get a full game?
@gunnerblog I can see Wenger starting Welbeck up top for that one
I dont know what is wrong with wenger why take off lacazette
Why does Wenger not give Lacazette a full game? ¬£50m to only play 70 mins a game?! ü§î #CRYARS #AFC

What a crap substitution from Wenger. I don't say that just bc I have Lacazette on my fantasy team. You have to sub our Wilshere there.
Wenger‚Äôs behaving like in Laca‚Äôs contract it says if he gets 90 he can leave the club.
Wenger doesn't see Lacazzette shame

Why will wenger sub off lacazette wen we re winning 3goals to 1 dis one tire me too #CRYARS
All wenger knows is substitute Lacazette off in 2nd halves

Nearly 2018, and Ars√®ne Wenger isn‚Äôt helping my blood pressure. Why take-off Lacazette?

Its bullshit how Wenger disrespects Lacazette every game by bringing him off. He was having a great game.
@Arsenal @LacazetteAlex Somebody ask Wenger why he can‚Äôt play 90 minutes, he deserves 90 minutes
How long until Lacazette (like the other quality players before him) realise Wenger is a stubborn head case and decides he wants out?
@DamkorDavid Wenger yanks him off as usual.

I see wenger playing alexis in 9 spot next game. #afc

Lacazette deserves better than Wenger.
Wise taking off Lacazette in all honesty from Wenger. 1-3 up and Giroud out injured.

@zacmorgans At least Wenger should let him enjoy playing, he can't play full 90 now that Giroud is not available, how

@Arsenal @LacazetteAlex Wenger spends a fortune on a striker who plays well and needs a goal, so what does he do, c‚Ä¶ 
Wilshere was supposed to be England's Xavi,  his Injuries and Wenger not being Pep slowed down that Genius. When he is fit, few are better.
I fail to understand why Wenger wouldn't allow Lacazette complete 90 mins. Dude's been brilliant all game.

@Arsenal @LacazetteAlex Fuck your first change.Wenger must have a heart attack and become a vegetable.thats the only way to get rid of him

Absolute travesty Wenger is taking Lacazette off so soon.
@PriyaFast1 Typical Wenger üò§üò§üò§üò§
Nobody in this world pisses me off like Arsene Wenger
Wenger‚Äôs slowly killing Lacazettes selfconfidence. He reslly needs 90 minüò°
I honestly do not understand the reason, the logic and the tactic behind Lacazette‚Äôs substitution... Wenger always takes him off!!
@gunnerblog Exactly. So you can‚Äôt claim its tactical with Wenger when he leaves others on for a full 90 and Lacazet‚Ä¶ 
@samuelJayC Think Wenger just wants to keep him fresh for the bigger games.
@UbaSocrates Man I don't know what it is, wenger is weird
Not Coquelin! 2 assists, looking sharp and yet subbed again by Wenger at 70mins. Must be a reason why @LacazetteAlex comes off? #CPFCvAFC
@Arsenal @LacazetteAlex WHY DOES WENGER HATE LACAZETTE??
@hay_kay_ess Mertens is quite old. Really doubt Wenger would bring him in. Draxler seems realistic. But I also don'‚Ä¶ 
Wenger do us a favour, resign. You are killing all you worked. How did he sub his rapid front 3 when he is winning?‚Ä¶ 
Premier league wenger 3, Sir Alex  13. That's the difference! 
Hey Wenger Lacazette scored 31 goals in the last 20min for Lyon last season
Does Wenger do lines at half time?
Arsenal fans complain Wenger‚Äôs reluctancy towards Lacazette starting and when Wenger subs him its the same.. make up your god damn mind
The day is coming when #Lacazette will just slap #Wenger because of this subbing nonsense #Arsenal  #FreeLacazette
Why is Wenger subbing @LacazetteAlex with 15mins to go?This is the time he can get his goals #CRYARS
Disappointing substitution. Lacazette worked hard tonight. What's he got to do to get 90 minutes Mr Wenger? 
"@mwanzaholic The ""Santi"" problem is officially solved.
One Arsene Wenger.

So Xhaka is down and could be injured now.....already brought on Coquelin cause he loves him what now then Wenger?!?!
Wenger is proper pissing me off constantly substituting Lacazette. It‚Äôs fucking up the bonus points in my FPL team.
Wenger just leave Laca and take someone else off na.
Why laca wenger üò¨ #arsenal
I wonder what Wenger will do with the Sanchez money? #bbcfootball

Wenger doesn‚Äôt fancy him that much.. isn‚Äôt that obvious ? 
Wondered my entire life why #Wenger makes late substitutions. Got it, he waits until three players are injured! Did‚Ä¶ 
Wenger subs off Lacazette but doesn't sub off Xhaka or Wilshere. And now Xhaka injured. Absolutely clueless.
What is it with Wenger and Lacazette?!?!? PLAY THE GUY FFS!!!!!!!!!!
Wenger is one of the most negative managers in football, he always subs attackers for defensive players
Wenger looking like a dickhead for not subbing off Xhaka for Coq now.
Does conte and wenger have a fetish of taking hazard or laca in the 70 min hour mark ffsüòÇ

Wenger takes lacazzete off all the time. Is Arsenal going to pay Lyon extra if dude plays 90min?

Wenger is just crazy 
Cause how the hell would a GW pass without a 'Wenger Out'? 
@gunnerblog @YankeeGunner Lacazette must surely be fresh as a daisy after being 'managed' so well by Wenger?
Coquelin is no where near good enough to be in an Arsenal shirt! Wenger only keeps him cause he‚Äôs French. Awful player
Wenger takes Lacazette off yet again on 70+ minutes! Grrrrrrrrrrrr?! I am pissed off about it, imagine how Lacazette feels!?!!
wenger subs laca to keep his goals per 90 mins ratio high lmao
Wenger needs to save Chambers and sub Wilshere asap
Why is Wenger doing this to Lacazette?
"Wenger must tell us why Lacazette can't play 90min. The likes of Lukaku &amp; Kane get 90 all the time. Why can't MaCasette?"
@piersmorgan You loving wenger now?
I‚Äôd just love to see our record signing play 90 mins for fuck sake Wenger
Wenger don't a fuck know his players. Lacazette just wants to play and score goals and he's desperately in need of one as well
Wenger becoming an obstacle for Laca. #CRYARS
Wenger always struggling with his zip is bad PR for Puma.

Wenger is definitely avoiding having to pay Lyon transfer bonuses.

@DalgIish Because Wenger is senile and wants all opposition to bow down to his wealth of experience before a ball has been kicked.
Wenger is ruining Lacazette isn‚Äôt he?
@Arsenal @Alexis_Sanchez thank God. Wenger almost kill the game with his nitwit sub. # COYG ü§òüí™üá≥üá¨‚ù§üëÄüôèüôáüôå

Wenger is Mr perfect to some of you,so it is pointless 
@MuthuiMkenya And yet this president has very high praise for his father figure Arsene Wenger!
@ArsenalInPidgin Na Wenger go tell Bellerin to sabi track down and close down runners? Na wenger go teach Kolasinac‚Ä¶ 
I wanted wenger to take Lacazette off and he did . We were winning 3-1 , and we‚Äôll play another tough away game on Sunday !!
Wenger wey dey sit down on top arsenal destiny 
@DannyGannon @AnkoorDesai @VirgilvDijk Auk now your now just talking crap again! That‚Äôs like saying Wenger can operate a zip.

Like Wenger, Steve Bould is a fraud. Organise your defence ffs.
Am begining to wonder if Lacazette wronged wenger somehow..it was very clear he was not happy being replaced
Saved ya job Wenger. #CRYARS
Wenger taking off Lacazette so Alexis can play ST and try and get a hat trick. I hate Wenger the wrinkly old mug
Why Wenger dey always Comot Lacazette
Congrats to Ars√®ne Wenger on becoming the manager with most PL games under his belt... He's been nothing but a legend at @Arsenal
Hate Wenger with such a passion!
@DenisORegan52 @arseblog His job is to try and zip up Wenger‚Äôs coat.
Love Arsenal but it‚Äôs hard to remain positive while Wenger is still in charge he‚Äôs not able to do the job anymore.‚Ä¶ 
West Brom was Alex Ferguson‚Äôs last game. Wenger‚Äôs gonna surpass his Premier League record... against West Brom.

Wenger needs to but a RB to keep Hector on his toes, ideally one that‚Äôs better than him
If Wenger wanted more security, Iwobi should've been the player to come on. Adding a defensive player doesn't mean more defensive security.

Win at last, but Wenger have to do something about the way his defense concide goals, so bad! And keep Lacazette for an entire game please!
